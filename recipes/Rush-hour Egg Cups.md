## Ingredients
Knob of butter
3 chestnut mushrooms, finely sliced
6 spring onions, finely sliced
1 red pepper, finely chopped
4 long stem broccoli, finely chopped
6 eggs, beaten
50g emmental, grated

## Method
1. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees C / 180 fan. Oil the six-cup muffin mould.
2. Melt the butter in a medium frying pan on a medium heat. Add the sliced mushrooms, sliced spring onions, chopped red pepper and chopped broccoli and fry them for 4-5 minutes, until softened. Set them aside to cool a little.
3. In a separate large bowl generously season the whisked eggs with salt and pepper.
4. Add the cooled vegetables and grated emmental to the eggs and stir to combine. Spoon the mixture equally into the cups of the muffin mould.
5. Bake the muffins in the oven for 15-17 minutes, or until risen and set. Leave them to cool slightly before removing them from the mould. Two muffins make a substantial breakfast there and then. The remainder will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for a further 2 days (you can reheat them in the microwave for 20 seconds before eating, if you with).
